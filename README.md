Hungarian Politics Filter
================================
A Chrome extension that removes Hungarian Politics from the Internet.


Overview
--------------------------
This extension was created originally by Rob Spectre to ignore Donal Trump from the internet. https://github.com/RobSpectre/Trump-Filter

I tried to find a solution to ignore hungarian politics.
I liked the idea and I forked this project to us to hide every hungarian politics from the internet.

The extension is during development.

Features
--------------------------

* Detects instances of any Hungarian Politics on web pages, warning users of the horror they may contain.
* Attempts to identify semantically sections of the page likely to contain Hungarian Politics and removes them from the page.
* Sensitivity settings to customize the aggressiveness of the filter - remove single references, chunks or the entire page.

Future features
--------------------------
* Optimize extension for the bigger sites (index, origo, facebook, twitter etc)
* External filter words list to update without update extension
* Add more filter words
* Enable/Disable option for individual sites (like AdBlocker)
